# Smart-garbage-monitoring-system
This project involves the use of an Arduino UNO microcontroller, a servo motor, two ultrasonic senosr, NodeMCU(ESP8266) development board which is for the Wi-Fi connection and a 16x2 LCD display that allows us to observe the level of garbage in the ThingSpeak cloud with the help of NodeMCU. When the bin is full, the lid will no longer open. The LCD display will present a message indicating the amount of rubbish in the bin. For the case of ultrasonic sensors, the first one is to sense the certain distance from the bin in order the lid to open, and for the second one, which is placed inside the bin so in order to keep track of the distance level of the trash occupied.
